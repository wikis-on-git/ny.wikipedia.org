A more mature Angela had eschewed her breakdancing ways and began to appreciate the traditional music of Zambia. She joined the Sakala Brothers as a backing vocalist, and in 2004, with Moses Sakala as her producer, manager and main songwriter, she released the album 'Malo Abwino'. It was an unprecedented blockbuster, resulting in hit songs and a nationwide tour. 'Malo Abwino established Angela’s musical style, combining traditional songs of tribes across Zambia with original compositions, including the title track, which was originally penned by Angela’s mother. It also established her as a fashion icon with her long trademark African print dresses and skirts, and tied headgear.

Subsequent albums, 'Ngoma' (2006), 'Zambian Girls' (2010) and 'Salary' (2015) continued that legacy and contributed to the re-emergence of traditional music styles such as kalindula and mantyantya, and their accompanying dances.

Angela lists her experience sharing the stage with Tshala Muana, Miriam Makeba and the Sakala Brothers as her most enduring memories. Performances in Malawi, South Africa, the UK and Poland have helped grow her profile [[https://www.musicinafrica.net/directory/angela-nyirenda-0| source]]
Angela has contributed massively to the growth of music in ZAMBIA and ensure that traditional songs are maintained for future use. Her song carries a very huge message to everyone and especially the Traditional leaders [[https://www.zambianmusic.net/artist?id=893&a=angela-nyirenda|2 ]]
