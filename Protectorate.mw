The legal regime of "protection" was the formal legal structure under which [[French colonial empire|French colonial forces]] expanded in Africa between the 1830s and 1900. Almost every pre-existing state in the area later covered by [[French West Africa]] was placed under protectorate status at some point, although [[wikt:direct rule|direct rule]] gradually replaced protectorate agreements. Formal ruling structures, or fictive recreations of them, were largely retained as the lowest level authority figure in the French [[Cercle (French colonial)|Cercles]], with leaders appointed and removed by French officials.<ref>See the classic account on this in Robert Delavignette.
